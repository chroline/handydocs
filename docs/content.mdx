Individual sections of a HandyDocs instance are saved as `mdx` files in the `public/docs` folder. These files are then imported
and processed by HandyDocs.

Each section must be added to the `toc` section of the HandyDocs configuration file. The `toc` section is simply an object
that maps filenames of the section to their respective titles in the order in which they should be displayed.

For example, if you have 3 sections:

1. **Section 1** stored as `section1.mdx`
2. **Section 2** stored as `section2.mdx`
3. **Section 3** stored as `section3.mdx`

then your `toc` section would look like:

```yaml
toc:
  section1: "Section 1"
  section2: "Section 2"
  section3: "Section 3"
```

# Content

All HandyDocs content is written in MDX. This means that all standard markdown features are supported, and you can use
additional custom components.

## Custom components

By default, HandyDocs supports chakra-ui alerts as custom components. If you want to create additional custom components
or include more chakra-ui components, be sure to include them in the `components` object in
`src/components/Content.tsx`.

<Alert status={"warning"}>

<AlertIcon />

`next-mdx-remote`, the plugin HandyDocs uses for importing and processing MDX files, does not support importing
components directly into content files. To use a custom component, they must be specified in the `components` object in
`src/components/Content.tsx`.

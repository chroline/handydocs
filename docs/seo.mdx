HandyDocs features built-in SEO thanks to the [`next-seo`](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) package. Site metadata
such as site name, favicon, open graph info, Twitter info, and more is controlled through the `seo` part of the
HandyDocs configuration file.

The `seo` part of the HandyDocs configuration file is the most flexible, structure wise. All data included in the `seo`
part of the HandyDocs configuration file is passed to `next-seo`, which makes it fully customizable.

The footer is found at the bottom of all HandyDocs instances. This is a location for you to conclude your documentation
by showing your logo, copyright, and social links.

The `footer` part of the HandyDocs configuration file follows a strict structure, represented by the following
Typescript interface:

```typescript
interface FooterConfig {
  copyright: string;
  socials: {
    github?: string;
    twitter?: string;
    email?: string;
  };
  style: {
    light: { bg: string; color: string; }
    dark?: { bg: string; color: string; }
  }
}
```

The footer uses the logo provided in the `hero` config section.

# `copyright`

Underneath the logo, a copyright message is displayed. The copyright message contains the copyright symbol ©, the
current year, and the content you type into the `copyright` field.

For example,

```yaml
copyright: "Cole Gawin. Released under MIT License."
```

will produce

```
© 2022 Cole Gawin. Released under MIT License.
```

for the copyright message.

# `socials`

You are able to customize which socials are displayed in the footer and where they link to. Currently, only Github,
Twitter, and email socials are supported, but expect more coming soon!

Each social link is optional, and the order in which they are included is the order in which they will be displayed.

```yaml
socials:
  github: https://github.com/chroline/handydocs
  twitter: https://twitter.com/colegawin_
  email: mailto:hey@colegaw.in
```

# `style`

HandyDocs allows you to customize the background and text color of the footer.

- **The background can be an image or a color.**

    ```yaml
    bg: url("/img/footer-bg.png") # image
    bg: "#000" # color
    ```

    The string that is passed to the `bg` property will be passed directly to a `background` CSS property, so any valid
    CSS background value is accepted.
- **The text color can be any color.**

    ```yaml
    color: "#fff"
    ```

    The string that is passed to the `color` property will be passed directly to a `color` CSS property, so any valid
    CSS color value is accepted.

You can also customize the footer style for dark and light modes.

```yaml
light:
  bg: "#fff"
  color: "#000"
dark:
  bg: "#000"
  color: "#fff"
```

<Alert status={"info"}>

<AlertIcon/>

`light` mode is required; `dark` mode is optional.

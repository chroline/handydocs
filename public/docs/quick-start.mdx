### _Easy as 1, 2, 3!_

1. Fork the [`chroline/handydocs`](https://github.com/chroline/handydocs) template repo. This will give you a blank
   canvas for your HandyDocs instance. (Or, use [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to scaffold your project
   by running `degit chroline/handydocs`)
2. Clone your forked repo to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone *YOUR_REPO*
   ```

3. Customize your instance and add content.

**...and then you're done!**

Since HandyDocs is built with JAMStack technologies, you can deploy your instance to your favorite serverless/static web
host provider like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/with/nextjs/).

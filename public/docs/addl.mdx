HandyDocs lets you customize different parts of your instance with custom SCSS styles. Let's run through some examples
of what can be customized.

# Chakra UI

HandyDocs is powered by chakra-ui, a React component library that allows for a great amount of styling and customization
options. Because chakra-ui makes use of CSS variables, you are able to access those variables in your custom styles.

For more information, read the article [CSS Variables - Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/features/css-variables) on
the official chakra-ui documentation.

# Fonts

You can customize the global font family used by HandyDocs by setting the `--handy-docs-font-family` CSS variable to
whatever font you choose.

```scss
html, body, :root {
  --handy-docs-font-family: 'Spline Sans', sans-serif
}
```

# Hero

You can add custom styles to the hero by assigning styles to the `#hero` element.

```scss
#hero {
  // styles here
}
```

# Content

You can add custom styles to your content as well by assigning styles to the `#content` element. Every documentation
section contains a `div#content` element, so your styles will only be applied to within the documentation content.

Here are some custom styles used by the official HandyDocs instance:

```scss
#content {
  > * {
    border-radius: var(--chakra-radii-md);
  }
  img, pre {
    border-radius: var(--chakra-radii-md);
  }
  img {
    box-shadow: var(--chakra-shadows-sm);
  }
  pre {
    box-shadow: var(--chakra-shadows-xs);
  }
}
```

# Syntax Highlighting

HandyDocs uses prism.js for syntax highlighting, and as such, you can use any prism.js themes to style your codeblocks.
You have the ability to include two separate syntax highlighting themes: one for dark mode, and one for light mode.
These files are located at `styles/syntax-highlighting/dark.scss` and `styles/syntax-highlighting/light.scss`,
respectively.

Simply paste your CSS/SCSS prism.js themes into these files, and your code will be highlighted as desired.

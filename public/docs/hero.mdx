The hero is the main part of your HandyDocs instanceâ€”it's the big, colorful section at the top of this instance. Your
HandyDocs instance doesn't have to look quite like this instance, however. HandyDocs offers a variety of customization
options to make your instance look exactly the way you want.

The `hero` part of the HandyDocs configuration file follows a strict structure, represented by the following Typescript
interface:

```typescript
interface HeroConfig {
  style: {
    light: { bg: string; color: string; }
    dark?: { bg: string; color: string; }
  }
  logo: { text: string; }
  subheading: string;
  info_boxes: Array<{
    icon: string;
    title: string;
    url: string;
  }>
}
```

As you can see, there are a lot of customizable options.

Let's take a deeper look into what each one does.

# `style`

HandyDocs allows you to customize the background and text color of the hero.

- **The background can be an image or a color.**

    ```yaml
    bg: url("/img/hero-bg.png") # image
    bg: "#000" # color
    ```

    The string that is passed to the `bg` property will be passed directly to a `background` CSS property, so any valid
    CSS background value is accepted.
- **The text color can be any color.**

    ```yaml
    color: "#fff"
    ```

    The string that is passed to the `color` property will be passed directly to a `color` CSS property, so any valid
    CSS color value is accepted.

You can also customize the hero style for dark and light modes.

```yaml
light:
  bg: "#fff"
  color: "#000"
dark:
  bg: "#000"
  color: "#fff"
```

<Alert status={"info"}>

<AlertIcon/>

`light` mode is required; `dark` mode is optional.

</Alert>

# `logo`

To customize your instance's logo, you will use the `logo` property. Currently, only text logos are supported, but image
support is coming soon!

Simply pass the name of your instance to the `logo.name` property

```yaml
logo:
  name: "HandyDocs"
```

# `subheading`

The subheading is the short description located underneath the logo in the hero.

```yaml
subheading: "minimal but capable documentation template"
```

# `info_boxes`

Info boxes are the big links at the bottom of the hero. There are typically 2-5 info boxes in the hero.

The icon of the info box is displayed as a [CSS mask](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask), so you can use
an SVG image as the icon. Simply place the SVG file in the `public` folder and link it to the `icon` property.

```yaml
info_boxes:
  - icon: "icons/twitter.svg"
    title: "@colegawin_"
    url: "https://twitter.com/colegawin_"
  - icon: "icons/github.svg"
    title: GITHUB
    url: "https://github.com/chroline/handydocs"
  - icon: "icons/git-branch.svg"
    title: 0.0.0
    url: "#"
```
